# Final Project Proposal
=======
My proposed idea for this final project is to generate an audio visualizer for a song of my own creation. I really enjoy everything about making music, and started using a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to actually capture certain musical ideas in November of 2024. This spring semester (2026), I took a sound production course which involved similiar processes that I had been teaching myself. As a result I've been able to refine my own skills, and now I'd like to carry some of my personal passion into this class by creating a colorful visual of my audio.

The idea for this project is inspired by a desire to create something artistic through code. An artist who creates wonderful visuals through p5.js is Patt Vira, and her sketches can be found on the website. Flow fields will also be an influence in this piece, considering how fluid music can be. But, for the most part, color and vibrancy will be prioritized over movement.

I know that it will be nessecary to conduct much research in order to see this project become a reality. The immediately present techniques that I will need to familiarize myself with are using audio (especially my own file) in studio code. I will also need to learn about synching code with frequencies.

Since the final project is due May 5, I have already begun researching. This so far has involved mostly Youtube videos, but I intend to write some detailed notes out and begin drafting this project before Monday the 28th. The week before the due date, I will work on this project every day. The goal will be to "complete" it before Friday so that I can refine and polish it the weekend before the due date.

This week i have prepared my audio, extensively researched and gathered inspiration, and plan on starting to draft the beginnings of this project tomorrow (Thursday the 24th).
