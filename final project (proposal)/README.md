# Final Project Proposal

My proposed idea for this final project is to generate an audio visualizer for a song of my own creation. I really enjoy everything about making music, and started using a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to actually capture certain musical ideas in November of 2024. This spring semester (2026), I took a sound production course which involved similiar processes that I had been teaching myself. As a result I've been able to refine my own skills, and now I'd like to carry some of my personal passion into this class by creating a colorful visual of my audio.
